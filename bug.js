The issue arises when attempting to retrieve data from a Firestore collection using a query that involves multiple `where` clauses with different field types (e.g., combining a string comparison with a numerical comparison).  The query might return an empty result set even when documents matching the criteria exist. This often occurs when there's a subtle mismatch in data types between your query's expectations and the actual data stored in Firestore.
